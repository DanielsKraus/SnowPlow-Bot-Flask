# SnowPlow-Bot-Flask
  A webapp created using Flask and Opencv for streaming video on a Raspberry Pi.  The website displays controls and streamed video so you can teleop the robot in what ever environment you wish.  This is done by pushing a button on the website which will send commands to the robot via serial from the Raspberry Pi to an Arduino.  After button is pushed it is printed what action is made to the terminal.
